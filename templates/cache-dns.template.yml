# You can use this template to cache DNS lookups for
#
# BAMZOOKA_DB_HOST
# BAMZOOKA_DB_BACKUP_HOST
# BAMZOOKA_REDIS_HOST
# BAMZOOKA_REDIS_SLAVE_HOST
#
# If you are using a hostname vs IP for these entries and have
# an internal DNS outage Bamzooka will stop working
#
# This template allows you to cache entry in the hosts file
#
# Note, for this to work correctly you must also install the
# bamzooka-prometheus plugin to collect stats
